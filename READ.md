# The Globe Bank Project

Globe Bank is a project for school. It is a tutorial from LinkedIn/Learning called [PHP and MySQL Essential Training: Part I ](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/php-with-mysql-essential-training-1-the-basics/welcome?u=57691225)

To make it run, you will need to create a file called **db_credentials.php** and store it in the `private` folder. Copy the following and paste it in the **db_credentials** folder, then add your connection information.

define("DB_SERVER", "");
define("DB_USER", "");
define("DB_PASS", "");
define("DB_NAME", "globe_bank");
